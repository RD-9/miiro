# MiiRo Bot
The MiiRo Bot is a build-it-yourself robot designed by RD9 Solutions that teaches you the fundamentals of electronics, programming and robotics to ensure that you are relevant in an ever-changing future.This Bot is aimed at the younger robotic engineer and is designed to allow for quick and easy setup. This repository contains all the resources you need to get started with your robot. Don’t have a MiiRo Bot? No problem. Visit www.rd-9.co.za to get yours shipped straight to you. 

## Getting started
To get started, download the MiiCode student app from either the Google play store or Apple AppStore. The Miicode app uses a blockly based programming platform which is used to communicate with the robot from either your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. The app also contains all the resources and curriculum needed to learn robotics.

To get familiar with the hardware and the Miicode app, please have a look at the getting started document in the getting started folder. 

Note: All the resources in this repository can be found within the robot support tab within your Miicode app.

## Assembly of robot
The MiiRo Bot is designed in a 3D puzzle format. The assembly instructions folder contains all the instructions needed to assemble your robot. You will also notice that there are three documents in the folder. These instructions are for the extender packs which you may have purchased with the MiiRo Bot and would want to integrate with. 

## Calibration
No two things are exactly alike. The same goes for robotics and motors. Although the motors used on the MiiRo Bot are the same, there might be slight differences. This may cause your robot to move more to the left or right. To account for this, we need to calibrate the robot. This is done by adding an ‘offset’ to the motors.

For example, if we see the robot favouring the left motor. We add some number to that motor which will correct the movement to be equal to the other motor. This is done in the calibration tab in the MiiCode app. The sheet which can be used for the calibration of the robot is found in the calibration folder or robot support tab in the MiiCode app. This sheet contains the step-by-step instructions on how to calibrate your robot.

## Firmware
The firmware used to program the MiiRo Bot has been open-sourced and can be found in the firmware folder in this repository. Therefore, if you feel you want to try out Arduino C programming with the MiiRo Bot feel free to jump straight in. You can then always load the original firmware by accessing it here.

## Curriculum
All the curriculum is available in the MiiCode app in the curriculum tab. This does require you to log in and create a profile. We are constantly updating this curriculum to ensure that the information is current, up to date and relevant to current world trends. 

## Extensions kits
The MiiRo Bot allows for a range of extensions which can be found on www.rd-9.co.za. As mentioned these instructions are present in the Assembly instructions folder. These kits are:

### MiiExpansion pack
This pack contains different linkages and fasteners to add to the functionality of the robot. This is compatible with all the robots designed by RD9 Solutions.
